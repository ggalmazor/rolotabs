Rolotabs turns your bookmarks into a persistent, always-visible sidebar. Each bookmark becomes a slot that can be loaded (with a live tab) or unloaded (icon stays, tab is gone). Clicking always focuses the existing tab or opens a new one — never duplicates.

How it works

The sidebar has three zones:
📌 Pinned (top): Compact icon grid of your most-used sites
📚 Bookmarks (middle): Hierarchical tree with collapsible folders
🔓 Open Tabs (bottom): Tabs that aren't bookmarked yet

Drag tabs between zones to organize them. Drag folders to reorder or nest them.

Features
• Live favicons that update in real time
• Keyboard shortcuts: Alt+S to toggle the sidebar, Alt+C to copy the current URL
• Right-click menus for renaming, pinning, replacing URLs, and more
• Navigated-away indicator when a tab drifts from its bookmarked URL
• Active tab peek inside collapsed folders
• Light and dark theme (follows your system)

All data is stored as regular Chrome bookmarks — synced across devices automatically. No accounts, no servers, no tracking.
