# Privacy Policy — Rolotabs

**Last updated:** February 12, 2026

## Summary

Rolotabs does not collect, transmit, or share any user data. All data stays on your device.

## What data Rolotabs accesses

Rolotabs accesses the following Chrome APIs to function:

- **Bookmarks** — to read, create, move, rename, and delete bookmarks
- **Tabs** — to detect open tabs, focus existing tabs, and avoid duplicates
- **Tab Groups** — to organize tabs into labeled groups in the tab strip
- **Favicon** — to display website icons in the sidebar
- **Storage** — to save local preferences (pinned order, collapsed folders, onboarding state)
- **Side Panel** — to render the sidebar UI
- **Offscreen** — to copy URLs to the clipboard via keyboard shortcut

## What Rolotabs does NOT do

- ❌ Collect personal information
- ❌ Transmit any data to external servers
- ❌ Use analytics, tracking, or telemetry
- ❌ Sell or share data with third parties
- ❌ Load remote code or external scripts

## Where data is stored

All data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in bookmark system and `chrome.storage.local`. Bookmark data syncs across your devices through Chrome's own sync feature — Rolotabs has no involvement in or access to that process.

## Changes to this policy

If this policy changes, the update will be posted here with a new date. Since Rolotabs collects no data, meaningful changes are unlikely.
